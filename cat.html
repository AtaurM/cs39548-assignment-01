      The cat is a obligate carnivores that survive off hunting smaller prey, they are solitude hunter.
      However modern day house cat discard the need for hunt and have invented a new skill set, which is to meow loudly to call upon their owner's attention
      for needs. Cats will meow loudly in demanding their basic needs and as well as expressing their emotional distress much like a infant cat that call upon their mother.
      Modern day house cat are also scared of cucumber that is placed unexpectedly behind them, a funny prank to play 
      on house cat by their owner, They will react by jumping off the ground.
