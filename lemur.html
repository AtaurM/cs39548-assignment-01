        Lemurs are wet-nosed primates of the superfamily Lemuroidea divided into 8 families and consisting of 15 genera and around 100 existing species.
        They are endemic to the island of Madagascar.
        Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail.
        They chiefly live in trees and are active at night.

        Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, living in groups known as troops.
        They communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals.
        Lemurs have a relatively low basal metabolic rate, and as a result may exhibit dormancy such as hibernation or torpor.
        They also have seasonal breeding and female social dominance.
        Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists.
        Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets.

        Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution.
        Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used.
