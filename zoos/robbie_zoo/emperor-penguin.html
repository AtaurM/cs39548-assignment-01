      The emperor penguin is a large flightless bird that lives in Arctica. They grow around 45 inches in height and can weight up to 88 pounds.
	  They breed during the winter, during which the female emperor penguin lays a single egg then leaves to gather food, leaving the male to take care of it.
	  The male penguin balances the egg on its feet and inside a brood pouch, which is used to keep the egg warm. This last for around 110 days, during which the male penguin goes without food and may lose as much as 45 pounds.
	  The female penguin then returns with food to feed the now hatched chicks.
