      The capybara is a giant rodent that is indigenous to South America. It is the largest extant rodent and stands at 2 feet tall at the shoulder.
	  It lives near water and eats water plants, and uses the water to escape from predators on land. It also uses water to keep cool during the day, and eats during the dawn and dusk.
