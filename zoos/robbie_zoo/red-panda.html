      The red panda is a small mammal that lives in Southwestern China and in the Eastern Himalayas. It primarily eats bamboo and lives in trees. 
	  The fur on its limbs and its belly is black, while some of the fur on its head, around the sides and eyes, is white. It is currently threatened by poaching and habitat destruction.
