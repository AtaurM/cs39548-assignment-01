      The red panda is a small mammal that lives in Southwestern China and in the Eastern Himalayas. They primarily eat bamboo and live in trees. 
	  The fur on their limbs and their belly are black, while some of the fur on their head, around the sides and eyes, are white. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction
