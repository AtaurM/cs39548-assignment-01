    <p>
		The muskrat is a large rodent that has adapted to life in and around water. It is a very common species in the wetlands of North America. 
		They are commonly considered pests because they eat crops and can block waterways with their nests. 
		The winter is a period of relative inactivity. The muskrat spends most of its eating and resting until the spring.
