		The muskrat is a large rodent that has adapted to life in and around water. It is a very common species in the wetlands of North America. 
		They are commonly considered pests because they eat crops and can block waterways with their nests. 
		For the muskrat, the winter is a period of relative inactivity. It spends most of its time eating and resting until the spring.
