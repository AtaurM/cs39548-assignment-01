      With their perky crest and natural curiosity, 
      cockatoos are among the most well-known and loved 
      members of the parrot family. They are found in 
      Australia and the smaller island countries to the 
      north and west, and they live in forested areas of 
      all types, from eucalyptus groves to pine forests and 
      rainforests. They can also live in the lower slopes 
      of mountain areas as well as mangroves and open country 
      lands, to feed on grass seeds.

      Cockatoos are LOUD and noisy! They are arguably the loudest 
      of all the parrots and scream to communicate with one another, 
      or just for the sheer joy of making noise. That loud voice is 
      a great adaptation for living in thick, dark forests, helping 
      each bird communicate with others over long distances, even 
      though they are out of sight.
