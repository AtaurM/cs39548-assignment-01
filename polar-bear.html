      The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. 
      It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed.
      The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb).
      The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. 
      The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat.
      It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump.
      Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat.
      The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.

      Polar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems.
      They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer.
      They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals, particularly ringed seals.
      Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by.
      The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber.
      Other prey include walruses, beluga whales and some terrestrial animals.
      Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land.
      During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals.
      Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter.
      Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years.
